##           INSTALLATION
To run the product-card locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
Copy code   [ git clone https://github.com/ephysians/product-card.git ]
2. Navigate to the project directory: Copy code [ cd product-card ]
3. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

##             USAGE
Once you have the project running, the product-card will load with a default product. You can interact with the card in the 
following ways:

* Display Product: The card displays the product's name, price, description, and image.
* Next/Previous Buttons: Clicking the next or previous buttons updates the card with the details of the next or previous product 
  in the list.
* Refresh Button: Clicking the refresh button fetches a new random product from the API and updates the card accordingly.


##    Configuration
The product-card uses an external API to fetch product data. By default, it is configured to use a sample API. 
If you want to use your own API or modify the existing one, follow these steps:

### 1. Open the script.js file in a text editor.
###2. Locate the API_URL constant at the top of the file.
###3. Update the value of API_URL with your desired API endpoint.
